# This Wall Will Fall
This is an incremental game which symobolises my existence currently. Starting projects and never finishing them. So the real questions are:
Does this project fall into the same category?<br>
Will I be able to end something I start?<br>
If I end it, will all my other insecurities leak out of me into a pool of goop which slithers slowly down the nearest sewage drain?<br>

The answers:<br>
Probably<br>
Probably Not<br>
Probably Not
