# This Wall Will Fall
This is an incremental game which symobolises my existence currently. Starting projects and never finishing them. So the real questions are:
Does this project fall into the same category?
Will I be able to end something I start?
If I end it, will all my other insecurities leak out of me into a pool of good which slithers slowly down the nearest sewage drain?

The answers:
Probably
Probably Not
Probably Not
