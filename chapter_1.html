Chapter 1:
<h1>Hesitance</h1>
<br>
<div>
  You've travelled so far, over such a long period, it's difficult to remember where you came from. Now this! A wall that stretches in all directions seemingly forever. You put so much effort into your journey, to be hampered like this. Bricks, rows and stacks of bricks. 
</div>
<div>
  No. You refuse to let this be it. It's just a barrier and barriers can be broken down. You raise your hands, clenched fists, thrust your arms and hope for the best.
